Scripts for generating HPC jobs for qshields and g4cuore with addition to upload to a DB
Runs in bash shell with python3.2 or greater.

### Run information
Run with:
>python3.X MC_ScriptGenerator.py -C CONFIG

Example config files are in the Geant4_HPC_Scripting/cfg_examples directory

This script will generate new scripts to be run in order (qshields -> g4cuore -> db (optional))

The qshield script generated creates a job array to run over the events and a script to hadd all the files into a single file (for easier use)

The g4cuore scripts give the option to use either the many files generated by the batch job, or the hadd file generated later

The db upload script sends the information about the scripts to the database

### Usage tips
Run the script and the config file for making a simulation and associated g4cuore processed simulation 
Rerun the script with the copied config file when uploading to the DB. The DB is accessible from ULITE only.

### Known Issues
Does not work with other batch systems besides PBS for the moment
